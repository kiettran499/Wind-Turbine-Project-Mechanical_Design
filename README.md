# Wind-Turbine-Project-Mechanical_Design

I.	Introduction

The idea of this assignment - Mechanical Engineering Design and Analysis is working on an industrial engineering project as an engineer in a company. The task involves designing gearbox in a horizontal axis wind turbines for an offshore wind farm that is around 20 kilometers from the coast. The wind turbine works as the mechanism. Its operation is turning the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical power which is then utilized to generate electricity by turning a generator. 
For the system which Iâ€™m going to design, the wind turbine will be the simplified version. The fundamental design parameters of the wind turbine include of bearing, main shaft, high-speed shaft, gear in the gearbox, brake, and key.

II.	Problem Statements

There are some primary design specifications for the wind turbine. Firstly, weight and size are optimized to be as small as possible, and material is selected based on operational conditions. For the shaft, the length of main shaft is about 0.15 m and high-speed shaft is 0.1 m and they should be in line. The axial load (thrust) on the bearing from a drag to lift ratio of the blades equal to 0.2. The center of lift of the blades is 10m from the centerline of the hub, bearing selection and shaft key must meet operational conditions. For the gearbox, transmission ratio, gear type and arrangement must meet operational conditions. The operational conditions of the design are the blades will rotate at 60 RPM while the generator will spin at 750 RPM to create 3 MW (Maximum) of useable electricity at maximum operational wind speed. The powertrain, which includes the generator, has an overall efficiency of 80%. Furthermore, the system is planned to run continuously for 8 years, reliability is 99%, and safety factor is 2 for all parts.
