# Wind-Turbine-Project-Mechanical_Design

I.	Introduction

The idea of this assignment - Mechanical Engineering Design and Analysis is working on an industrial engineering project as an engineer in a company. The task involves designing gearbox in a horizontal axis wind turbines for an offshore wind farm that is around 20 kilometers from the coast. The wind turbine works as the mechanism. Its operation is turning the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical power which is then utilized to generate electricity by turning a generator. 
For the system which Iâ€™m going to design, the wind turbine will be the simplified version. The fundamental design parameters of the wind turbine include of bearing, main shaft, high-speed shaft, gear in the gearbox, brake, and key.
